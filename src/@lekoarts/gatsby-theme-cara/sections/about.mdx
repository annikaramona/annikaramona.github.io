## About

> I'm excited to bring my diverse background and skills to a dynamic data science team.

I completed my undergraduate studies in biology and psychology at Washington State University, where I discovered my love for the intersection of these fields in the study of behavior and health.  During that time, I also had the opportunity to assist a family with an autistic son, which deepened my understanding of the importance of using data to improve health outcomes for individuals and communities.  

Inspired by this passion, I joined the Peace Corps and spent two years in Nepal, working alongside local communities to develop and implement sustainable health interventions.  My experiences in Nepal taught me the value of listening to local perspectives and collaborating with diverse stakeholders to create meaningful change.

After completing my service, I pursued a Master's degree in Public Health at the University of California, Berkely, where I focused on using data to drive evidence-based decision making in global health.  I gained valuable experience in statistical analysis, data management, and data visualization, and I had the opportunity to work on several projects focused on improving health outcomes in low-income areas.  

When I'm not working, I enjoy hiking, cooking and exploring new cultures.  I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself and learn new skills, and I'm passionate about using my talents to make a positive impact on the world.  

Thanks for taking the time to learn more about me, and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.
