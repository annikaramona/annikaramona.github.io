## About

> I am thrilled to contribute my diverse background and skills to a dynamic data science team

I completed my B.S. in Biology and Psychology at Washington State University, where I discovered my passion for environmental science and health equity.  

Fueled by this passion, I joined the Peace Corps and taught English in rural Nepal while learning from the local community.  This experience deepened my understanding of environmental equity, and motivated me to acquire skills in public health and data analytics to drive change.

This led me to pursue a Master in Public Health in Environmental Health Sciences from the University of California, Berkeley, where I have focused on statistics and using data to drive evidence-based decision making in environmental health.  

Through my work, I have developed valuable skills in **statistical analysis**, **risk and exposure assessment**, and **data visualization**.

When I'm not working, I enjoy running, baking, and exploring new cultures.  I'm always eager to challenge myself and to learn new skills, and I find fulfillment in using my talents to create a positive impact.
